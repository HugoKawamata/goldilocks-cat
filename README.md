Physical objects fall into categories. Some categories are very specific (e.g. “Big Mac”, “red-bellied black snake”). Some categories are very non-specific (e.g. “Edible matter”, “Organism”).

There appears to be a goldilocks category for every instance of a physical object, which is the least specific category an item can fall into while still being a practical/useful category in everyday life. The goldilocks category is what a majority of people would consider the **main** or most important classfier of an object.

I hypothesise that the goldilocks category for a given physical object can be determined by asking people to assign labels to a collection of physical objects, none of which share the same goldilocks category. The labels assigned to each object by a majority of people can be considered the goldilocks category for each object. If two objects in the collection share a goldilocks category, or fit into a category even more specific than the goldilocks category, I hypothesise that people will use a more specific label than the goldilocks category in an attempt to clarify the difference between those two objects. The experiment can be done by assigning an expected goldilocks category to each object and comparing this to the results.
